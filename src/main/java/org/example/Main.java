//Step 1: Create a Java class "Student" that should have the following properties: First name, Last name, Student ID.
//Step 2: Create a Java List for elements of type "Student" and add multiple students.
//Step 3: Create a class "School" to which students can be added through a method ('addStudent').
//Step 4: Implement a method to print all students of the school (as text, to the console).
//Step 5: Add a method to find a student by their ID. The found student should be returned.
//Step 6: Create a method to remove a student from the school.
//Step 7: Expand the Java-List project with a class called "Course" that has the following properties: course name, instructor, room.
//Step 8: Add a method to the Student class to add courses to the student (courses in which the student is participating).
//Step 9: Implement a method within the School class to retrieve all courses of a specific student (based on a student ID).
//Step 10: Write a class 'Sack' that functions like an ArrayList. It can only use primitive data types and arrays.
//Step 11: Implement step by step the methods add, get, size, remove last, remove by index, and so on.
//Step 12: Write a class 'Beutel' that functions like the 'Sack', but only uses primitive data types (no arrays!!!).
//Step 13: Again, implement step by step the methods add, get, size, remove last, remove by index, and so on.
